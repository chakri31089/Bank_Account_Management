# Bank_Account_Management
Implement a simple console-based banking management system in C++.
Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

## Class Definition: Bank_Account
* The class Bank_Account defines properties and methods to manage bank accounts.
* Private data members: Money_Deposit (balance), type (account type), acno (account number), name (account holder's name).

#### Public methods:
* report(): Display account details.
* retMoney_Deposit(): Return balance.
* create_Bank_Account(): Create a new bank account.
* dep(int x): Deposit money.
* retacno(), rettype(): Return account number and type.
* Display_Account(): Display account details.
* Updation(): Update account details.
* draw(int x): Withdraw money.

## File Operations and Main Menu
* The main() function displays a menu for various banking operations.
* Options include creating a new account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, displaying all accounts, closing an account, updating an account, and exiting.

## File Handling Functions
* Functions like write_Bank_Account(), delete_Bank_Account(), display_sp(), display_all(), Updation_Bank_Account(), Money_Deposit_withdraw() perform operations like writing, deleting, displaying specific or all accounts, updating account details, depositing, and withdrawing money by interacting with a file named "Bank_Account.dat".

## Data Storage
* The data of each Bank_Account object is stored in a binary file named "Bank_Account.dat".
* Data is stored and retrieved using file handling operations (ofstream, ifstream, fstream) to write and read objects of Bank_Account class.

## User Interaction
* The program interacts with the user by displaying menus and taking input for various banking operations like creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, etc.
* The user can perform these operations by entering options corresponding to the displayed menu items.

## Overall Functionality
The code aims to simulate a basic banking system where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, update account details, and perform other essential banking operations through a console-based interface.

This code provides a simple understanding of a banking system, it may lack certain error handling and edge cases that are crucial in a real-world banking application.
